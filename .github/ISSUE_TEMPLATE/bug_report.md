Do the checklist before filing an issue:

- Maybe someone else already had the problem? Please check if there is already an issue for your concern.
- Have a usage question? Maybe our [users guide](https://fraunhoferisst.github.io/diva-docs/user-docs/#requirements) can point you to the right direction
- Something does not work on your machine? Make sure to take a look at the [deployment guide](https://fraunhoferisst.github.io/diva-docs/dev-docs/deployment/)
- Troubles with docker deployment? In the [intsructions for Docker](https://fraunhoferisst.github.io/diva-docs/dev-docs/deployment/docker.html) anything should be covered that is needed for deployment with Docker

Nothing of the above helps, create a bug report (THIS CAN BE REMOVED)
