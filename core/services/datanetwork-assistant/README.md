# Data Network Assistant üõ†Ô∏è

The service builds the representation and replication of the entities in a graph and provides an API to manage relations between them.
It reacts to the entities events and creates/deletes node in `neo4j`. Through the API these nodes can be further connected
to build meaningful entities relations graph. While publishing node events, the services propagates the event data of the 
origin entities events (e.g. `attributedTo`)

## Requirements

+ Node.js v14.16.x

+ Running instance of `neo4j:4.3.7-community`
