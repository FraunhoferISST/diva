# DIVA Core User Management Service

User Management exposes a REST API for CRUD operations on users and user images and is responsible for
user authentication. The OpenAPI 3.0 specification can be found in [apiDoc/openAPI.yml](./apiDoc/openapi.yml).

## Requirements

+ Node.js v14

## Environment variables

The following environment variables can be passed to the service through deployment:

| name | default  |
|---|---|
| port  | 3001  |
| MONGO_URI | mongodb://admin:admin@localhost:27017|
| CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN  | * |
| SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL  | http://localhost:3010 |
| KAFKA_URL  | broker:9092 |

## Setting up for Development

### Local

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

Start the service:

```sh
npm run start
```

### Tests

The e2e tests require a running MongoDB instance. We reuse the same instance in the development and testing environments. So make sure that you run the tests in the `NODE_ENV=test` mode. It is best to use the predefined npm scripts:

```sh
# e2e test
npm run test:e2e
# unit tests
npm run test:unit
```

### Docker

Use docker-compose to start the service in a container, build new service image and push the image to the GitLab docker registry.

Pull the image:

```sh
docker-compose pull usermanagement
```

Build the image:

```sh
docker-compose build usermanagement
```

Run the container:

```sh
docker-compose up -d usermanagement
```

Push the image:

```sh
docker-compose push usermanagement
```
