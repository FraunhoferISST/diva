# Schema Registry ðŸ“”

This service provides an HTTP API to distribute file-based schemata. It serves JSON and AsyncAPI schemas 
used by the most of the core services.

The versioning on the service must indicate both the changes on the service source code as well the changes at the **schemata**!
For example, extending a schema with new properties can be treated as feature. Removal of some properties or changes in type
definitions must increment major version and indicate breaking changes.

## Requirements
