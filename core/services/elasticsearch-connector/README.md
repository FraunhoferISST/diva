# Elasticsearch Connector ðŸ”—

This service connects to an `elasticsearch` instance and transfers the metadata of our entities. `DIVA` uses `elasticsearch` as search and analytics engine.

## Requirements

+ Node.js 14.16.x
+ A running `elasticsearch:7.10.x`
+ A running `neo4j`
+ A running `MongoDB`
+ A running `kafka` broker with `zookeeper`
+ Other services that populate events

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Docker

Use docker-compose to start the service in a container, build new service image and push the image to the GitLab docker registry.

Pull the image:

```sh
docker-compose pull elasticsearch-connector
```

Build the image:

```sh
docker-compose build elasticsearch-connector
```

Run the container:

```sh
