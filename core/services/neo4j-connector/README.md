# Neo4J Connector ðŸ”—

This service connects to an `neo4j` instance and transfers the metadata of our entities to create, update, and delete nodes. `DIVA` uses `neo4j` to store a so called datanetwork that interconnects metadata.

## Requirements

+ Node.js 14.16.x
+ A running `neo4j:4.3.7-community`
+ A running `kafka` broker with `zookeeper`
+ Other services that populate events (e.g. `resource-management`)

## Environment Variables

|ASYNCAPI_SPECIFICATION|asyncapi|name of the `asyncapi` schema to be loaded|
|KAFKA_URL|<broker:9092>|where the Kafka broker is located to read events from|

## Setting up for Development
