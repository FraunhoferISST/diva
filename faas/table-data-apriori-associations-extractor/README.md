# Table Data Apriori Associations Extractor Microservice

This service gets a CSV table data file as input, extracts its content and provides the
associations by Apriori algorithm as output. The produced JSON result is written to the output file.

## ðŸ§  About Apriori
The apriori algorithm uncovers hidden structures in categorical data. The classical example is a database containing purchases from a supermarket. Every purchase has a number of items associated with it. We would like to uncover association rules such as {bread, eggs} -> {bacon} from the data. This is the goal of association rule learning, and the Apriori algorithm is arguably the most famous algorithm for this problem. This repository contains an efficient, well-tested implementation of the apriori algorithm as descriped in the original paper by Agrawal et al, published in 1994.
